<tt>#include <cuMat/Dense></tt>

This page explains how to use cuMat to solve linear systems, compute the determinant and inverse of a matrix, and use various decompositions like LU, QR and SVD.

\section TutorialLinAlg_Basic Basic Linear Algebra
This section explains the basic linear algebra routines that are directly available as methods of \ref MatrixBase. 
They are used if you don't care about the underlying algorithm and let cuMat choose the best algorithm.

\note For some methods here and very small matrices (up to 3x3 or 4x4), explicit solvers are available that don't use decompositions like LU.

\subsection TutorialLinAlg_Basic_Determinant Computing the determinant

The determinant can be computed with \link MatrixBase::determinant() determinant()\endlink.
Further, often, only the logarithm of the determinant is needed. It can be evaluated numerically much more stable and is available as \link MatrixBase::logDeterminant() logDeterminant()\endlink.

Example:
<table class="example">
<tr><th>Example:</th><th>Output:</th></tr>
<tr><td>
\include TutorialLinAlg_determinant.cu
</td>
<td>
\verbinclude TutorialLinAlg_determinant.out
</td></tr></table>

\note The log-determinant is only available for positive-definite Hermitian matrices. Otherwise, the determinant of a real matrix might be negative and the logarithm is not defined over the reals anymore.

\subsection TutorialLinAlg_Basic_Inverse Inverse matrix

\note No direct access implemented yet, use the decompositions below instead

\section TutorialLinAlg_Decompositions Decompositions

If you want to solve linear systems or want more control over the algorithm it is preferred to directly call the decompositions.
They provide further additional checks like tests if a matrix is invertible.

All decompositions inherit from \ref DecompositionBase and provide the following interface:

 - Compute the inverse matrix with \ref DecompositionBase::inverse()
 - Compute the deterimant with \ref DecompositionBase::determinant() and the log-determinant with \ref DecompositionBase::logDeterminant()
 - Solve linear systems with (possibly batched) matrix-valued right-hand sides \ref SolverBase::solve()

For details, see the documentation of the decompositions:

 - \ref LUDecomposition
 - \ref CholeskyDecomposition
